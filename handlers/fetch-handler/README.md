## Enschedule fetch function
Usage

```json
{
  "url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": "{\"payload\": \"ping\"}"
}
```

Provide HTTP parameters as data to send a request. It will be sent by the built in fetch function. The response will be logged.
